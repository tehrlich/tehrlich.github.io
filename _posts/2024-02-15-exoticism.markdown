Omar Thomas, Danielle Fisher, and I presented a clinic on cultural appropriation and exoticism in band music at the 2024 Texas Music Educators Clinic Convention. Our goal was to discuss the topic from three perspectives:Â scholar, composer, and educator. If you're interested in the slide deck, you can find it below, and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQJCWfXgU6L7yvAWa13jEbx6p0yUAnT5bDuQqWGGpkE/edit) is a link to quite a few resources from musicological, educational, and philosophical perspectives.
