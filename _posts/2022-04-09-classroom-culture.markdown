This past week, I had the pleasure of guest conducting and teaching at Oklahoma State University. When meeting with my dear friend and colleague Tyler Austin, I asked him what he’d like for me to present to his secondary methods music education students. His answer was very open-ended, but centered on being an active educator. Shortly after that, I asked my current student teacher, “what are things you wish you learned during your undergraduate music education degree?’

The below slide deck is centered on classroom culture (I’ve come to despise the term "classroom management"), fundamentals, and pacing. The philosophies (abstract) and strategies (concrete) are tenets of my five years of teaching at Decatur High School and Centennial High School. It’s been a pleasure to assemble this information before I return to graduate school full-time. I truly cherish my experience with the hundreds of incredible students I've worked with, and want to ensure that I have accessible documentation of how I was able to foster those positive relationships.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions, or if I can help you in any way in the future.
