Viet Cuong (University of Las Vegas) and I presented a session entitled, "Three Keys for an Artistic Performance of Wind Band Music" at the 2023 Georgia Music Educators In-Service Conference and the Texas Music Educators Clinic Convention. The session was designed to guide secondary music educators through reflecting on their score study processes, unifying their performances with the composerâ€™s artistic vision, and answering common interpretive questions due to shortcomings and vagueness in our system of notation. The slides are below, and the handout is linked [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDlYeSPQGg53ue5ftpRUkKp3hAJe2uz4m-52ACtk3-o/edit#)

Please contact me if you'd like the session recording. Viet's website is available [here.](https://vietcuongmusic.com/)
