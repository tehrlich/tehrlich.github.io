## Emory Wind Ensemble Repertoire, Spring 2021

After meeting strictly online during Fall 2020, we were able to resume an in-person wind ensemble in Spring 2021. Personnel was limited to adhere to a 12-foot distance requirement between musicians, but this nonetheless allowed us to form two chamber ensembles: a brass choir and a chamber winds ensemble.
