>When I was a little girl I never missed a concert of Miriam Anderson, Roland Hayes and Abbie Mitchell. I was always thrilled by their singing of Spirituals at the end of each concert. Audiences were thrilled too. So I felt cheated and wanted some Spirituals at the ends of my concerts, too … I began to experiment for myself and set several for the piano.

## About the Transcription
I. Valley of the Bones (3’)<br>
II. The Bells (4’)<br>
III. Troubled Water (5’)

Score is transposed.

*Spiritual Suite* for piano by Margaret Bonds has existed in multiple editions since the third movement *Troubled Water* was first published as a standalone work by Sam Fox Publishing Company in 1967. Decades later, Louise Toppin uncovered that *Troubled Water* was in fact the final movement of the larger *Spiritual Suite*. Videmus Music published the complete work in 2020 in an edition by Toppin, followed by an arrangement of *Troubled Water* for cello and piano in 2023. While this wind ensemble transcription is primarily based on the original version for piano, several ideas are borrowed from the arrangement for cello and piano.

Particular adaptations were necessary for the work to be successful for wind ensemble. Bonds includes very few tempi in her manuscript, and recordings of the *Spiritual Suite* make heavy use of rubato. I strongly encourage conductors to study the existing versions and listen to the performances listed below to inform their own interpretation. My hope is that this transcription brings wind band audiences to the music of Margaret Bonds. The premiere of this version by The University of Texas Wind Ensemble took place on October 13, 2024, with the arranger conducting.
