Jonathan Grantham (Director of Bands at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California) and I presented a NAfME webinar on October 19 that focused on classroom culture. Our goal was to provide attendees with questions for reflection on their classroom environment, opportunities to set goals for how they'd like their classrooms to feel, and concrete strategies to increase student voice in daily activities.

Jon has been one of my closest friends since 2019 and this was the first opportunity for us to collaborate on a talk. We had a blast!

Please contact me if you'd like the session recording. Jon's blog is available [here.](https://accidentalexpertise.wordpress.com/)
