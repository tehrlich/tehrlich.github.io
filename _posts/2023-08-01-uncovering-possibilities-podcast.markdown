excerpt: "Alt-Ac Opportunities in the Arts"

intro2:
  - excerpt: 'Artists of all disciplines in graduate school are often focused on the singular goal of a professorship in higher education upon graduation. While there are opportunities for artists outside of the academy (“alt-ac”), securing these gigs can be overwhelming. Few resources exist for those considering augmenting their careers with these “non-traditional” endeavors. In particular, there is a need for resources that feature the stories of artists who hold historically underrepresented identities. Ogechi Ukazu and I received a grant from Texas Career Engagement to create content interviewing folks who have bridged this divide. We hope this content is useful as you consider your professional journey!'
