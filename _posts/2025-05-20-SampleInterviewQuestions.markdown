5. What is your approach to ensuring student buy-in and keeping motivation consistent during the season? 
6. What do you believe is the role of a university marching band?
7. How does a university marching band fit into a School of Music environment?
8. How will you elevate the game day experience, and what are the ways you have done this previously?
9. What does a marching band rehearsal led by you look like?
10. What does the culture of a university marching band look like under your direction?
11. How do you keep your alumni content with tradition while steering the program in your desired direction?
12. When working with limited rehearsal time, how do you get your show on the field as quickly as possible while creating an excellent experience for students?

## Music Education/Conducting
1. Our conducting sequence is [XYZ.] What is your philosophy for teaching a sequence of that kind?
2. What insights from your background will you bring to teaching music education courses at X university?

4. What is your experience with large group logistics at previous institutions?

## Tenurability
1. What are your professional goals for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? (N.B. This can also be a “will they stay?” question.)
2. In this role you will need to balance teaching alongside creativity activities and service. What projects will you pursue, and how will you balance them with your other responsibilities?

## Miscellaneous
1. What is something we wouldn’t learn from your vita?
2. Tell us something interesting about yourself as if we were out to dinner.
